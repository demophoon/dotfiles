Britt Gresham's Dotfiles Repo
=============================

A place to store my dotfiles. Use them as is or for inspiration for your own dotfiles.

This is now the third iteration of my dotfiles. The first iteration was bash centered, the second iteration moved into zsh, now we play with Nix.
Read more about my adventure with Nix at https://devlog.brittg.com/tags/nix/
